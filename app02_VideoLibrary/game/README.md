Cube3d @ 42
This consist of a simple game to collect all the squares and exit with your time. 
It was developed in 2022 at 42 Lisboa, in C.
I have modified it to make it compatible, but the structure/game was there before. 


#This is called inside build from the root dir
run cmake -S . -B build 
to create dir build and then the 'cube' game is set to create (into the root dir) (needed for the game to run)

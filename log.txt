Diary of What I did.
Now I know using namespace std; is not ideal, but it saves time for the purpose of these exersises.

11.May
-Started on app00, 
	-Defined Business, Product and User
-Next define UI, Show products, step into product to delete, update ...
-Next Next, add clients and add a queue to accept incoming request
I wanted to log my hours but I forgot to count


12.May
-problem with duplicate in compilation, so for now isNumeric1 and isNumeric will hold
-defined transaction and clients, need to create interface and then store transaction in csv file log
-create a thread also.
-[more fun than i expected]
-Next algorithms to transactions


13.May
-problem of duplicated not looked into.... for last
-transactions accomplished, can make CSV file later today....
-threads are working, just need to stop user input so doesnt interfere with UI
--NEED to work on, better UI, but im not a front end dev.

-UI is betterâˆš
-thread stopping input of text,
-open and close business, + thread handling

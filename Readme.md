Assignment: To create an in-terminal application mimicking 3 Things
    -business/transactions
    -healthcare/patients
    -games/genre

Due Monday 22nd of May.
----------------------------


ASSIGNMENT 1: 
    -I decided to build an adjustable interface to fit any business. 
    -You give your name and start making inventory.
    -Customers are hard coded, ideally this would be an api call or some sort of DB.
    -Once you see customers wanting to buy, you will see you queue increase
    -You can decided to checkout or reject
    -Invoice will be added to logsCSV so you don't have to keep count

What I can improve is making a bit more practical. Happy with the outcome so far, after just 3 days and my first project for CMS. It was a good feeling.
I would like to carry it further in the UI aspect and organize better the inventory, so I can implement it for algorithms and sorting. Something I did in Assignment 3.



ASSIGNMENT 2:
    -I made a hospital, as best as I could, as fast as I could. With only 3 days again, it was a bit of a mess honestly, but smooth in the end.
    -This takes an argument in the AV and has 3 interfaces
        -Doctors- unfortunetly they don't do much, and can only self destroy themselves y archiving. Which means they wont be granted access to log back in.
        -Patients- a bit more interesting, they can book appointments by dates, after they attend the appointment, doctors [or by random] will give the 'alta' or 'baja'
            -They need to request the 'alta' before they can attend another appointment just to be safe.
            -If no patient id is passed into AV a new patiend will create. Else if ID, it logs back into your account. Although appoinments are not parsed into the program. Sorry.
        -Admin- control everything through an ui which is fast. 

I got hit in too many directions trying to build the project from every angel as if I was a 5 man team. This tought me a valuable lesson for the last project where I carefully designed and planned before getting into.
Irony: I was most excited to do this one, but it was the one I miss-managed most. 



ASSIGNMENT 3:
    -Honestly surprised. It turned out very cool.
    -Parsing of a csv file with not too much columns, but man what it can do
        -Sort
        -Filter
        -Add
        -Play, to turn those highscores into real
    -Happy to put my early version of wolfstein 3d Cube, adapting it to what was needed, it creates random maps for each 'Title' and outputs a score by the time taken to collect all the squares.

Very Happy, very fun to do the last one. Probably because I was a week better programmer... I then went back and organized all the project and getting for submition on Monday. Hope to see you then.



TO RUN: sh init.sh
------------------------------
No help was recieved, chatGPT to solve some doubts or make silly-easy-tedious code
Overall I am happy from my experience of the last 9 days. Learned where I can improve, just wish for the opportunity to do so.

Thank you,
